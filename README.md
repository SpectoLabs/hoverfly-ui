Hoverfly UI is the Angular 4 frontend application that is bundled with [Hoverfly](https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly).

## Prerequisites
The project is generated by [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) v1.1.0, which requires Node 6.9.0 or higher, and NPM 3 or higher.
You also need [Hoverfly](https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly) v0.12.0 or higher which can enable developer mode.

## Getting started
Install dependencies with npm: 
```
$ npm install
```
Then run Hoverfly in developer mode. This is to enable Cross Origin Resource Sharing headers, which will enable the Hoverfly UI to successfully communicate with Hoverfly across ports.

```
$ hoverfly -dev
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
